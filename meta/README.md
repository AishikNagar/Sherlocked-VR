# Sherlocked-VR ðŸš¨
  * Influenced by the witty Sherlock Holmes, we wanted to test our own capabilities in this incredibly challenging **Escape Room**. So are you down for the challenge?
  * The virtual reality game creates **different puzzles and ciphers** for the user to interact with. It is a test of the user's patience and intelligence. Don't worry, there are no stakes here but it prepares you for real life where the consequences are real.
  * The project was completely developed in **Unity (2019.2.18f1)**, generated apk works with smartphones using google cardboard. Apart from  the above, android sdk & java dk were also required.
  * The entire movement, interaction, inventory system and every intricacy of the game was coded manually. We brainstormed everything ranging from the storyline to the clues and the overall mechanics of the game.

## To test the application, you'll need:
  * [Google Cardboard](https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/)
  * Android smartphone (API level >= 19)
  
## Working





## Installation 
  1. Clone the repository and transfer the apk to your android smartphone, make sure **android version is 4.4 + (KitKat)**.
  2. Install the application on your phone and launch it.
  3. Attach the smartphone to the google cardboard and enjoy the simulation.

## Moving Forward
  1. Setting up a **virtual inventory** which can be viewed at some part of the screen.
  2. Initialising a **timer** to record the times in which different users finish the task.
  3. Implementing **multi-player VR levels** which involve different rooms and simultanous actions for success.
